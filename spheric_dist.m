%  function dist=spheric_dist(lat1,lat2,lon1,lon2)
%
% compute distances for a simple spheric earth
%
%   input:
%
%  lat1 : latitude of first point (matrix)
%  lon1 : longitude of first point (matrix)
%  lat2 : latitude of second point (matrix)
%  lon2 : longitude of second point (matrix)
%
%   output:
%  dist : distance from first point to second point (matrix)
